# Cloudflare Worker Management Interface

## API Keys Management Page Created

A comprehensive API keys management interface has been created at:
`ticker-backend-worker2-deployed/public/api-keys-management.html`

### Features:
- **Worker Connection Testing** - Configure and test your CF Worker URL
- **API Key Validation** - Test the hardcoded keys (`tk_demo_key_12345`, `tk_test_67890`)
- **Endpoint Testing Suite** - Interactive tests for all worker endpoints
- **Real-time Response Logging** - Monitor API calls with full response data
- **Usage Guide** - Complete curl examples and integration instructions

### Current API Keys in Worker:
- `tk_demo_key_12345` - Demo key for testing
- `tk_test_67890` - Test key for development  
- `TICKER_API_KEY` - Environment variable key (if configured)

### Usage:
1. Deploy your Cloudflare Worker
2. Open the management page in a browser
3. Enter your worker URL (e.g., `https://your-worker.workers.dev`)
4. Test connection and validate API functionality
5. Use the testing suite to verify all endpoints

### Note:
The management page is located in the worker directory which is gitignored to avoid nested repository conflicts. The page is designed specifically for the Cloudflare Worker's authentication system and API structure.
